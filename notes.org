** Lexer
I'm going with a fully fledged parser for the initial Assembler project, so it can be reused in the compiler project.

** Assembler
Basic assembler that maps symbols/tokens to machine instructions.  Output is a text file with "binary" values written out as string; internally they're all going to be represented by 16 bit constants that are then OR'd together and converted to a string representation at the end.

** Parser
TBD

** Compiler
TBD
