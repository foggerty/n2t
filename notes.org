* To-Do
- [ ] Get this org file to export the README section every time it's saved.

* Readme
A collection of tools for the [[http://nand2tetris.org/][Nand2Tetris project.]]

** Lexer
I'm going with a fully fledged parser for the initial Assembler project, so it can be reused in the compiler project.

** Assembler
Basic assembler that maps symbols/tokens to machine instructions.  Output is a text file with "binary" values written out as string; internally they're all going to be represented by 16 bit constants that are then OR'd together and converted to a string representation at the end.

** Parser
TBD

** Compiler
TBD

* Lexer

 - [X] Wrapper around a hash table for the symbol table.  Don't worry about where stuff is located for now, just one file.
 - [X] Look into Go best practices for organising packages, and reorganise :-)
 - [ ] Find out how the documentation package works, so can document code accordingly
 - [ ] Read up on tests and write some for has table - can I get these running from Emacs?
 - [ ] Code to strip all white space (other than carriage returns)/comments
 - [ ] Work out if everything that I've made public actually needs to be.  i.e. AsmInstruct isn't useful if you're just making an assembler, giving it a text file and expecting instructib
 - [ ] go through the names.  Kinda not great, plus prob over complicating things
